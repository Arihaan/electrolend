DIRECT HARDHAT CONSOLE DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

Instead of using scripts, let's use Hardhat console to deploy directly. Follow these steps:

1. Start the Hardhat console connected to Electroneum testnet:
```
npx hardhat console --network testnet
```

2. Once in the console, run the following commands one by one:

// Get deployer account
const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
console.log("Deploying with", await deployer.getAddress());

// Check balance
console.log("Balance:", ethers.utils.formatEther(await deployer.getBalance()));

// Get the factory for LendingPoolAddressesProviderRegistry
const RegistryFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("LendingPoolAddressesProviderRegistry");

// Deploy with 50 gwei gas price to ensure it goes through
const registry = await RegistryFactory.deploy(
  await deployer.getAddress(),
  { 
    gasPrice: ethers.utils.parseUnits("50", "gwei"), 
    gasLimit: 4000000
  }
);

// Log the transaction hash
console.log("Transaction hash:", registry.deployTransaction.hash);

// Wait for deployment to be confirmed
console.log("Waiting for confirmation...");
await registry.deployed();

// Verify the contract was actually deployed
console.log("Deployed to:", registry.address);
console.log("Owner:", await registry.owner());

// Exit the console when done
.exit
